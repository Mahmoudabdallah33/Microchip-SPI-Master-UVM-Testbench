# Microchip-SPI-Master-UVM-Testbench
Serial peripheral interface (SPI) is one of the most widely used interfaces
between microcontroller and peripheral ICs such as sensors, ADCs, DACs,
shift registers, SRAM, and others
# 
# 
SPI is a synchronous, full duplex main-subnode-based interface. The data
from the main or the subnode is synchronized on the rising or falling clock edge.
# 
# 
The SPI interface is 4 4-wire SPI interface.
4-wire SPI devices have four signals:
1-  Clock (SPI CLK, SCK)
2-  Slave select (SS)
3-  Main out, subnode in (MOSI)
4-  Main in, subnode out (MISO)
